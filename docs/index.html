A team of the “good guys” could be analagous to the US government, military, or police force, while the “villains” in the movie depict a foreign power. Cyborgs and AI will often adopt East Asian features and accents, which furthers stereotypes about East Asians (primarily East Asian women) being submissive, subservient, or unfeeling. Many of the post-2000 movies also shift their focus from East Asia to other regions of the world, most notably the Middle East and its relationship to the US military. The most significant example of this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which many have pointed to as glorifying the US airforce and depicting imperialism and colonialism in a positive light.</h5>

Science fiction has always been an imagining of our fears of the future, and pushing the blame for a fictional apocalypse on a real racial minority has off-screen consequences. Anxieties depicted in media inevitably result in violence, and Asian Americans have historically been forced to face the consequences of their fictional counterparts.</h5>
