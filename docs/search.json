These movies and others often imagine apocalyptic futures and hyper-technological societies, and often draw from East Asian cityscapes for inspiration. Cyborgs and robots in American science fiction are also often modeled after East Asian women, and are depicted as subservient, submissive, and unfeeling. This phenomenon has been dubbed “Techno Orientalism”, or the depiction of East Asia as both technologically advanced and intellectually/morally primitive. This project will explore interest in science fiction films over time and compare it to GDPs of East Asian countries to evaluate whether or not science fiction is a reaction to Yellow Peril.\nData\nThe data used to create this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset\nOther Sources and Images\nRoh, David S., et al. Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction, History, and Media.

      "contents": "\nScience Fiction and Techno Orientalism\nModel\nThe first plot shows the number of science fiction movies each year. Filmmakers’ interest in science fiction increased in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\n\nThe next 3 graphs show GDP of Japan, China, and Singapore, which are countries that often serve as backdrops in science fiction movies. Films such as Blade Runner and Big Hero 6 both model their setting after Japanese cities, and many films use these backdrops to communicate bleak, apocalyptic futures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome events to note are Japan’s economic rise in the 1980’s and 1990’s, Singapore’s growth in the 1990s, and China’s growth in the late 2000s. The following graph shows the number of user ratings for each movie, and gives the title, release year, and plot summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[1916,1916,1916,1923,1932,1933,1933,1933,1933,1936,1938,1941,1941,1943,1943,1944,1944,1944,1945,1945,1948,1948,1950,1950,1951,1951,1951,1951,1951,1952,1952,1953,1953,1953,1953,1954,1954,1954,1955,1955,1957,1957,1957,1957,1957,1957,1957,1957,1958,1958,1958,1958,1958,1958,1958,1958,1958,1958,1959,1959,1959,1959,1959,1959,1959,1960,1960,1961,1961,1962,1962,1962,1963,1964,1964,1964,1964,1965,1966,1966,1966,1966,1966,1968,1970,1970,1971,1971,1972,1972,1972,1973,1973,1973,1973,1974,1974,1974,1974,1974,1976,1976,1976,1976,1977,1977,1978,1978,1978,1978,1979,1979,1979,1980,1980,1980,1980,1980,1980,1980,1980,1980,1980,1981,1981,1982,1982,1982,1982,1982,1982,1982,1983,1983,1983,1983,1984,1984,1984,1984,1984,1984,1985,1987,1987,1987,1988,1988,1988,1988,1989,1989,1989,1989,1989,1989,1990,1990,1990,1990,1990,1990,1990,1990,1990,1991,1992,1993,1993,1993,1993,1994,1994,1994,1995,1995,1995,1995,1996,1996,1996,1996,1996,1996,1996,1996,1996,1997,1997,1997,1997,1997,1997,1997,1998,1998,1998,1998,1998,1998,1998,1998,1999,1999,1999,1999,1999,1999,1999,1999,2000,2000,2001,2001,2001,2001,2001,2001,2001,2002,2002,2002,2002,2002,2002,2002,2002,2003,2003,2004,2004,2004,2004,2004,2004,2005,2005,2005,2005,2006,2006,2006,2006,2006,2006,2006,2006,2007,2007,2007,2007,2007,2007,2007,2007,2007,2007,2008,2008,2009,2009,2009,2009,2009,2009,2009,2010,2010,2010,2010,2010,2010,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2015,2015,2015,2015,2016,2016,2016,2016,2016,2016,2016,2016,2016,2017,2017,2017,2017,2017,2017,2017,2017,2017,2018,2018,2019],\"y\":[1501,1501,1501,131,2960,77507,77507,77507,301,2119,289,1200,907,717,617,777,777,777,112,149,929,929,624,378,151,151,151,184,891,1139,352,1349,4467,529,504,490,598,898,115,1456,2149,1307,35407,293,864,381,206,423,4765,1956,929,786,786,555,342,1207,1157,1780,924,3052,3413,975,4349,3887,3887,1243,1602,214,777,286,883,806,2323,314,314,306,996,735,227,234,1514,1593,551,1262,726,7989,1722,1390,1685,5701,2218,868,823,181,181,21755,3832,469,853,352,389,1274,4559,3277,248,4449,304,13281,13281,13281,2935,79886,337,10427,2580,2241,250,600,600,585,738,1827,20927,1296,4319,677998,4143,618,5580,5580,1472,111532,401,1119,2560,2560,10431,1235,11368,11368,11368,41736,54717,2812,228279,228279,312,615,615,2110,28526,980,911,156,156,1354,267,267,1329,57296,8593,766,143605,79909,3227,271,261,155477,846021,45130,45130,733,63996,3041,1024,1761,173,177164,24697,1689,520255,520255,206535,2833,375,119,284,201,249088,5340,5340,179,179,2465,240114,4400,26996,155,155,108775,713,910502,9385,146064,1299,5971,27480,27480,748,150995,638,562022,728383,118060,22363,290954,2966,4618,87736,668,29815,495,308150,58257,331801,675212,2230,965,248768,96229,532565,212109,63333,102113,102113,1249,279887,297368,297368,4073,209,141873,12948,5335,268239,21873,78768,1063,146484,161,161,161,534,489497,275928,14654,589274,121,23253,347291,232,232,128732,10778,236,2680,203,937,706284,208732,85700,309135,89685,12980,157,363670,519061,8459,8459,8459,8459,8459,105,20346,334427,233458,237285,11336,251828,1241220,1241220,876,56011,189179,2928,6707,747,66390,739816,476845,459808,7673,7673,30920,1697,509,2956,719085,18148,112923,213760,213760,4651,61589,722685,569512,40360,15271,612550,8889,644241,38340,38340,110,3104,192,164,464,464,464,464,464,90841,494060,1367,161,16882,695,2083],\"text\":[\"Title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea <br /> Plot: A French professor and his daughter accompany Captain Nemo on an adventure aboard a submarine. <br /> Year Released: 1916\",\"Title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea <br /> Plot: A French professor and his daughter accompany Captain Nemo on an adventure aboard a submarine. <br /> Year Released: 1916\",\"Title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea <br /> Plot: A French professor and his daughter accompany Captain Nemo on an adventure aboard a submarine. <br /> Year Released: 1916\",\"Title: Black Oxen <br /> Plot: A Manhattan playboy falls in love with a mysterious European woman, whom he notices as an exact double for a famous socialite who disappeared at the turn of the century.

A team of the “good guys” could be analagous to the US government, military, or police force, while the “villains” in the movie depict a foreign power. Cyborgs and AI will often adopt East Asian features and accents, which furthers stereotypes about East Asians (primarily East Asian women) being submissive, subservient, or unfeeling. Many of the post-2000 movies also shift their focus from East Asia to other regions of the world, most notably the Middle East and its relationship to the US military. The most significant example of this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which many have pointed to as glorifying the US airforce and depicting imperialism and colonialism in a positive light.\n\n\n\nAbove: Scene from Captain Marvel (2019)\n\n\n\nAbove: Scene from Blade Runner (1982)\n\n\n\nAbove: Scene from Cloud Atlas (2012)\nConclusion\nMass media affects our worldview long after we leave the movie theater. Science fiction has always been an imagining of our fears of the future, and pushing the blame for a fictional apocalypse on a real racial minority has off-screen consequences. Anxieties depicted in media inevitably result in violence, and Asian Americans have historically been forced to face the consequences of their fictional counterparts.\n\n\n\n",
